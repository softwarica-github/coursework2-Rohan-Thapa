In this project I have created a simple online banking system. Here the server is set up at localhost with port number 1234 and various clients from various port number does connect with the client.

In this project I have got two main program files. Among them are server.py and client.py. For this we need to go to the main directory of the project and then run these files.

Firslty we need to run the server as the server need to be started before the client sends any request. To run the server following commands need to be given in project directory.

For Windows system:
>python server.py

For Mac and Linux systems:
>python3 server.py

After starting the server we can also start the client for user interface and interaction. To run the client,

For Windows system:
>python client.py

For Mac and Linux systems:
>python3 client.py

After which the whole system might be running as an inital usage there will be no users in the project so we need to create a new user so we need to `sign-up` initally.
